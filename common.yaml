abstract: 
    Resident tissue macrophages (RTM) are differentiated immune cells populating distinct niches and exhibiting important tissue-supportive functions. RTM maintenance is thought to rely on either monocyte engraftment and differentiation, or RTM self-renewal. Here, we developed an inducible mouse model of lung interstitial macrophage (IM) niche depletion and repopulation to investigate IM development in vivo. Using time-course single-cell RNA-sequencing analyses, bone marrow chimeras and gene targeting, we found that engrafted Ly6C+ classical monocytes could self-renew locally in a CSF1R-dependent manner before their differentiation into RTM. We further showed that the switch from monocyte proliferation towards IM subset specification was controlled by MafB, while c-Maf specifically regulated the identity of the CD206+ IM subset. Our data shed new light on the transcriptional regulation of IM development and provide evidence that, in the mononuclear phagocyte system, self-renewal is not merely restricted to myeloid progenitor cells and mature macrophages, but is also a tightly regulated capability of mature monocytes developing into RTM in vivo.
