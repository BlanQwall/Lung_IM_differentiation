   abstract = {Resident tissue macrophages (RTM) can fulfill various tasks during development, homeostasis, inflammation and repair. In the lung, non-alveolar RTM, called interstitial macrophages (IM), importantly contribute to tissue homeostasis but remain little characterized. Here we show, using single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq), two phenotypically distinct subpopulations of long-lived monocyte-derived IM, i.e. CD206+ and CD206−IM, as well as a discrete population of extravasating CD64+CD16.2+ monocytes. CD206+ IM are peribronchial self-maintaining RTM that constitutively produce high levels of chemokines and immunosuppressive cytokines. Conversely, CD206−IM preferentially populate the alveolar interstitium and exhibit features of antigen-presenting cells. In addition, our data support that CD64+CD16.2+ monocytes arise from intravascular Ly-6Clo patrolling monocytes that enter the tissue at steady-state to become putative precursors of CD206−IM. This study expands our knowledge about the complexity of lung IM and reveals an ontogenic pathway for one IM subset, an important step for elaborating future macrophage-targeted therapies.},

   abstract = {We present Vision, a tool for annotating the sources of variation in single cell RNA-seq data in an automated and scalable manner. Vision operates directly on the manifold of cell-cell similarity and employs a flexible annotation approach that can operate either with or without preconceived stratification of the cells into groups or along a continuum. We demonstrate the utility of Vision in several case studies and show that it can derive important sources of cellular variation and link them to experimental meta-data even with relatively homogeneous sets of cells. Vision produces an interactive, low latency and feature rich web-based report that can be easily shared among researchers, thus facilitating data dissemination and collaboration.},

@article{Subramanian2005,
   abstract = {Although genomewide RNA expression analysis has become a routine tool in biomedical research, extracting biological insight from such information remains a major challenge. Here, we describe a powerful analytical method called Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) for interpreting gene expression data. The method derives its power by focusing on gene sets, that is, groups of genes that share common biological function, chromosomal location, or regulation. We demonstrate how GSEA yields insights into several cancer-related data sets, including leukemia and lung cancer. Notably, where single-gene analysis finds little similarity between two independent studies of patient survival in lung cancer, GSEA reveals many biological pathways in common. The GSEA method is embodied in a freely available software package, together with an initial database of 1,325 biologically defined gene sets. © 2005 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.},
