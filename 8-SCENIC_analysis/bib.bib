   abstract = {SCENIC enables simultaneous regulatory network inference and robust cell clustering from single-cell RNA-seq data. We present SCENIC, a computational method for simultaneous gene regulatory network reconstruction and cell-state identification from single-cell RNA-seq data (
                  http://scenic.aertslab.org
                  
                ). On a compendium of single-cell data from tumors and brain, we demonstrate that cis-regulatory analysis can be exploited to guide the identification of transcription factors and cell states. SCENIC provides critical biological insights into the mechanisms driving cellular heterogeneity.},
